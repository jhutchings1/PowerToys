## Installing and running Microsoft PowerToys

### Requirements

- Windows 10 v1903 (build 18362) or better preferred, Windows 10 v1803 (build 17134) minimum.  
- Have [.NET Core 3.1 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.10-windows-x64-installer). The installer should handle this but we want to directly make people aware.

### Via GitHub with EXE [Recommended]

#### Stable version

Install from the [Microsoft PowerToys GitHub releases page][github-release-link]. Click on `Assets` to show the files available in the release and then click on `PowerToysSetup-0.27.1-x64.exe` to download the PowerToys installer.

This is our preferred method.

#### Experimental version
To install the Video Conference mute, please use the [v0.28 pre-release experimental version of PowerToys][github-prerelease-link] to try out this version. It includes all improvements from v0.27 in addition to the Video conference utility. Click on `Assets` to show the files available in the release and then download the .exe installer.


### Via WinGet (Preview)
Download PowerToys from [WinGet](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases). To install PowerToys, run the following command from the command line / PowerShell:

```powershell
WinGet install powertoys
```

### Other install methods

There are [community driven install methods](./doc/unofficialInstallMethods.md) such as Chocolatey and Scoop.  If these are your preferred install solutions, this will have the install instructions.
